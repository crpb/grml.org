***** Results will be available soon.... ****************

Hi,

I am pleased to announce that I am running a grml user survey.  The
purpose of this is to help grml developers gain a better idea of what
the grml user community is really doing and using, and what aspects
people would most like to see improved.

This user survey is heavily based on the survey done by Bryan O'Sullivan
for the Mercurial Project:
http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2006-April/007513.html
Mercurial is a great distributed version control system used at grml, see
http://grml.org/mercurial/

Please participate! If you know grml users who do not read the
grml mailing list, please forward the survey to them and ask them to
take part. The more people that respond, the more useful the survey
will be!

Please send your responses directly to me (mika@grml.org), and do *not*
CC the mailing list.

Regarding privacy: I will not share your name or contact information
with anyone else unless you explicitly allow me to, but I may quote you
anonymously (unless you would prefer me not to).

At the end of February 2007 I will post a report to the grml mailing
list and the grml wiki.

Thanks again for taking part!
