Addition notes:
---------------

*) Try "grml pci=irqmask=0x0e98" if (you have a notebook and) your
PS/2 mouse doesn't work. (Possibly caused by a BIOS-flaw on your board,
BIOS updates can help.) Sometimes, switching to the text console with
Control-Alt-F1 and back to the X-screen with Control-Alt-F7 solves the
problem without rebooting, since the X server reinitializes the mouse
driver during that procedure.

*) Bootfrom needs access to a running grml-System with the same Kernel
as the Bootkernel, before it is able to mount the partition / ISO-Image.
This should allow a poor mans install from NTFS-Partitions and makes it
also possible to boot an ISO-Image directly. You can also use wildcards
in the ISO-Filename, but it must be unique. So: If you have just one
grml.iso on /dev/hda1 you can access it as: bootfrom=/dev/hda1/G*.iso,
but if there are several, you need to make clear, which one you want.
(Feature added by Fabian Franz.)

*) If your grml-CD makes strange noises during boot, or you see frequent
errors like "squashfs: read error", or programs are crashing randomly,
then your CD image is probably defective or incomplete, or your CD-burner
created a defective CD due to wrong writing speed or bad media. This is
the most common error reported.  Please boot with "grml testcd" to check
if the CD is OK, and/or even better, verify the MD5 checksums that are
present on the mirrors before writing the CD.  Check your CD low-level
via running 'readcd -c2scan dev=/dev/cdrom'. In some cases, defective
IDE controllers cause this error if you have DMA enabled. Also, please
read the grml-FAQ.

*) In case of a failing hardware autodetection, try booting with any of
the "no-" options as shown in the table above, like in
   grml noagp noapm noapic acpi=off nodma
to skip some critical parts of the autodetection system.

*) Some boards apparently don't pass the proper memory size to the 
linux-kernel. It may cause the message "Panic: cannot mount root file 
system" and the system hangs. Use "grml mem=128M" to solve that 
problem if your system has 128MByte memory for example (caution:
you MUST use a capital "M" here).

*) The "expert" mode provides a very simple interface to loading additional
Kernel modules from floppy disks (ext2 or vfat), plus interactive
configuration of mouse/keyboard/xserver. "expert" mode supports
the same boot options as "grml".

*) The "myconfig=/dev/partition" option allows you to reconfigure the
system after autoconfiguration by running a bourne shell script called
"grml.sh" and/or extracting configuration files from a file named
config.tbz from the root directory on the given device (or floppy).
Take a look at http://grml.org/config/ for more information regarding
the configuration framework of grml.

*) If you wish to remaster the CD, please don't forget to specify

        -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
        -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat

as option to mkisofs. Otherwise your CD won't be bootable. The
directory GRML, containig the compressed filesystem file "GRML",
must be located in the top level directory of the CD.

*) Caution: screensavers: Don't start xlock/vlock or any other screensaver
that requires a password. There are no default passwords on grml,
i.e. all accounts are LOCKED unless you explicitly set a password.
See also README_Security.txt about this issue.
Hint: If you accidentially started a screensaver switch to one of the
textconsoles by Control-Alt-F1 and kill the screensaver (or just set a
password for the grml user). Take a look at the script grml-lock.
