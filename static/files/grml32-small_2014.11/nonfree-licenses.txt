The following packages from the Debian non-free section are included in this release

Package: atmel-firmware
========================================================================
This Debian package is derived from atmel-firmware-1.2.tar.gz which is
available on-line at:

http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/atmel/atmel-firmware-1.2.tar.gz

The Debian package of atmel-firmware was created by Simon Kelley.

The bin files in the images were generated from header files
included with the 2.1.1 release of the "Atmel drivers", released
by Atmel corp in December 2002 and subsequent modifications,
downloaded from atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net 

The copyright on these files was modified (by Atmel corp)

you have a chance (or let us know when its up and we will download it).

The BCM_LEGAL.txt file should contain the following information:

- - - - - -

BCM firmware version 2.9
Copyright (c) 2000-2001 Broadcom Corporation

Contact info:
         bluetooth_help@broadcom.com

BlueFW will have:
         BCM2033_md.hex  -       BCM mini driver
         BCM2033_fw.bin  -       BCM firmware
         BCM.LEGAL.txt   -       Legal info

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

7.	MISCELLANEOUS

benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligation
hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such attempted assignment shall
be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to
a successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this
Agreement relates that is not a competitor of Broadcom.

7.3.	Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded.
The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter
hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of Orange,
California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.

7.4.	Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if
possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any
term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
terminated.

7.5.	Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that
may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and
obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement
in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.

7.6.	Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
default.

7.7.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and
representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.
This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in
writing.
