The following packages from the Debian non-free section are included in this release

Package: atmel-firmware
========================================================================
This Debian package is derived from atmel-firmware-1.2.tar.gz which is
available on-line at:

http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/atmel/atmel-firmware-1.2.tar.gz

The Debian package of atmel-firmware was created by Simon Kelley.

The bin files in the images were generated from header files
included with the 2.1.1 release of the "Atmel drivers", released
by Atmel corp in December 2002 and subsequent modifications,
downloaded from atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net 

The copyright on these files was modified (by Atmel corp)
in November 2004 to the form shown below.

Max,

Good news. We have Broadcom Corporate and Legal approval for release of our
firmware as part of the BlueZ posting. Send us a copy of it to load up when
you have a chance (or let us know when its up and we will download it).

The BCM_LEGAL.txt file should contain the following information:

- - - - - -

BCM firmware version 2.9
Copyright (c) 2000-2001 Broadcom Corporation

Contact info:
         bluetooth_help@broadcom.com

BlueFW will have:
         BCM2033_md.hex  -       BCM mini driver
         BCM2033_fw.bin  -       BCM firmware
         BCM.LEGAL.txt   -       Legal info

- - - - - -

We are going to make another release of firmware in about 2 weeks and will
definitely keep you in the loop.

Regards,

Craig

5.1.	Obligations.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any documentation
relating to the Software, and any other information (if such other information
is identified as confidential or should be recognized as confidential under the
circumstances) provided to Licensee by Broadcom hereunder (collectively,
“Confidential Information”) constitute the confidential and proprietary
information of Broadcom, and that Licensee’s protection thereof is an essential
condition to Licensee’s use and possession of the Software.  Licensee shall
retain all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to
any third party or use it in any way except under a written agreement with
terms and conditions at least as protective as the terms of this Section.
Licensee will exercise at least the same amount of diligence in preserving the
secrecy of the Confidential Information as it uses in preserving the secrecy of
its own most valuable confidential information, but in no event less than
reasonable diligence.  Information shall not be considered Confidential
Information if and to the extent that it: (i) was in the public domain at the
time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of
Licensee; (ii) was known to Licensee, without restriction, at the time of
disclosure as proven by the files of Licensee in existence at the time of
disclosure; or (iii) becomes known to Licensee, without restriction, from a
source other than Broadcom without breach of this Agreement by Licensee and
otherwise not in violation of Broadcom’s rights.

5.2.	Return of Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all

ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL BROADCOM’S LIABILITY WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY
LICENSEE FOR SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

7.	MISCELLANEOUS

7.1.	Export Regulations. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS
SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES AND OTHER APPLICABLE EXPORT-RELATED LAWS AND
REGULATIONS AND THAT YOU MAY NOT EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER THE SOFTWARE OR
ANY DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THOSE LAWS.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER OF THE SOFTWARE
TO CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED.

7.2	Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligation
hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such attempted assignment shall
be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to
a successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this
Agreement relates that is not a competitor of Broadcom.

7.3.	Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded.
The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter
hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of Orange,
California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.

7.4.	Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if
possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any
term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
terminated.

7.5.	Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that
may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and
obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement
in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.

7.6.	Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
default.

7.7.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and
representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.
This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in
writing.

License: License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software
 IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
 NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
 the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
 downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
 printed materials ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying,
 or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms
 of this LICENSE.  If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE,
 do not download the SOFTWARE.
 .
 RECITALS
 .
 Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
 hardware, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright
 laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
 property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE may be protected by various
 patents, and is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly
 in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected by various
 patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover that sale, since
 it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE.  This
 agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
 .
 1.  DEFINITIONS
 .
 1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that
 downloads or otherwise obtains the SOFTWARE.
 .
 2.  GRANT OF LICENSE
 .
 2.1  Rights and Limitations of Grant.  NVIDIA hereby grants Customer
 the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
 SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:
 .
 2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use multiple copies of the
 SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
 and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's
 use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use
 by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university)
 and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).
 .
 2.1.2  Open Source Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms
 of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE may be copied and redistributed solely for
 use on operating systems distributed under the terms of an OSI-approved
 open source license as listed by the Open Source Initiative at
 http://opensource.org, provided that the binary files thereof are not
 modified, and Customer provides a copy of this license with the SOFTWARE.
 .
 2.1.3  Limitations.
 .
 No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
 decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
 manner to obtain the source code.
 .
 Usage. SOFTWARE is licensed only for use with microprocessor(s) which have
 been (i) designed by NVIDIA and (ii) either (a) sold by or (b) licensed by
 NVIDIA. Customer shall not use SOFTWARE in conjunction with, nor cause
 SOFTWARE to be executed by, any other microprocessor.
 .
 No Translation. Customer shall not translate SOFTWARE, nor cause or permit
 SOFTWARE to be translated, from the architecture or language in which it is
 originally provided by NVIDIA, into any other architecture or language.
 .
 No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
 else.
 .
 3.  TERMINATION
 .
 This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to
 comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event,
 Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its
 component parts.
 .
 Defensive Suspension.  If Customer commences or participates in any legal
 proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
 suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided
 under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.
 .
 4.  COPYRIGHT
 .
 All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but
 not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
 music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE),
 the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE,
 are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected
 by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Accordingly,
 Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
 material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE
 and that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or
 archive purposes.
 .
 5.  APPLICABLE LAW
 .
 This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
 construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.
 .
 6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
 .
 6.1  No Warranties.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
 DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .
 6.2  No Liability for Consequential Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM
 EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR
 ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
 OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT
 OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7.  MISCELLANEOUS
 .
 The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
 Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  If any provision of this
 LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under,
 the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
 necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
 This agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between
 the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
 all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating
 to such subject matter, whether oral or written.  Customer agrees
 that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
 country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
 United States Bureau of Export Administration or any export laws,
 restrictions or regulations.  This LICENSE may only be modified in
 writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA.
