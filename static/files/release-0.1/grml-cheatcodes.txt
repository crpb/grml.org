                     CHEATCODES AND HINTS FOR GRML V0.1
==============================================================================

These options (can be combined) work from the isolinux bootprompt:

grml      acpi=off                  Disable ACPI configuration in Kernel 2.6
grml24    [Options...]              Boots with Kernel 2.4 (2.6 is default)
expert26  [Options...]              Expert mode
memtest                             Run memtest86 instead of Linux

Notice: some of the following options *might* *not* work.

The following options are probably broken:

grml noeject                        Do NOT eject CD after halt
grml noprompt                       Do NOT prompt to remove the CD
|-> grml 0.1 does not eject the CD
grml myconf=/dev/sda1               Run "grml.sh" from a partition
grml myconf=scan (or config=scan)    Try to find "grml.sh" automatically

*) Try "grml pci=irqmask=0x0e98" if (you have a notebook and) your
PS/2 mouse doesn't work. (Possibly caused by a BIOS-flaw on your board,
BIOS updates can help.) Sometimes, switching to the text console with
Control-Alt-F1 and back to the X-screen with Control-Alt-F7 solves the
problem without rebooting, since the X server reinitializes the mouse
driver during that procedure.

*) Bootfrom needs access to a running grml-System with the same Kernel
as the Bootkernel, before it is able to mount the partition / ISO-Image.
This should allow a poor mans install from NTFS-Partitions and makes it
also possible to boot an ISO-Image directly. You can also use wildcards
in the ISO-Filename, but it must be unique. So: If you have just one
GRML.iso on /dev/hda1 you can access it as: bootfrom=/dev/hda1/G*.iso,
but if there are several, you need to make clear, which one you want.
(Feature added by Fabian Franz.)

If your GRML CD makes strange noises during boot, or you see frequent
errors like "cloop: read error", or programs are crashing randomly, then
your CD image is probably defective or incomplete, or your CD-burner
created a defective CD due to wrong writing speed or bad media. This is
the most common error reported.  Please boot with "grml testcd" to check
if the CD is OK, and/or even better, verify the MD5 checksums that are
present on the mirrors before writing the CD. In some cases, defective
IDE controllers cause this error if you have DMA enabled. Also, please
read the GRML-FAQ.

In case of a failing hardware autodetection, try booting with any of
the "no-" options as shown in the table above, like in
   grml noagp noaudio noapm noapic acpi=off nodma nopcmcia noscsi nousb
to skip some critical parts of the autodetection system.

The "noswap" option is useful for a forensic analysis without touching
existing swap partitions.

Some Boards apparently don't pass the proper memory size to the 
linux-kernel. It may cause the message "Panic: cannot mount root file 
system" and the system hangs. Use "grml mem=128M" to solve that 
problem if your system has 128MByte memory for example (caution:
you MUST use a capital "M" here).

The "expert" mode provides a very simple interface to loading additional
Kernel modules from floppy disks (ext2 or vfat), plus interactive
configuration of mouse/keyboard/soundcard/xserver. "expert" mode supports
the same boot options as "grml".

The "floppyconfig" or "(my)config=/dev/partition" options allow you to
reconfigure the system after autoconfiguration by running a bourne shell
script called "grml.sh" from the root directory on the given device (or
floppy).  The shell script will also be executed at startup.
|-> Important: the option might be broken in this version of grml.

SCSI-Emulation is active for all CD-ROMs (unless you switch it off by
using the "atapicd" option), so IDE CD-Writers should work with the
installed versions of cdrecord and cdrdao.

If your BIOS does not support el torito booting from CD, you can create
two bootable floppy disks by issuing (from grml running on a different
machine) the command "mkbootfloppy", which will create a bootable
Kernel-disk plus a disk containing the initial ramdisk, which will be
prompted for at boottime.

If you wish to remaster the CD, please don't forget to specify
	-no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
	-b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat
as option to mkisofs. Otherwise your CD won't be bootable. The
directory GRML, containig the compressed filesystem file "GRML",
must be located in the top level directory of the CD.

Caution: X-Screensaver: Don't start xlock or any screensaver that
requires a password. There are no default passwords on GRML,
i.e. all accounts are LOCKED unless you explicitly set a password.
See also README_Security.txt about this issue.
If you accidentially started a screensaver switch to one of the
textconsoles by Control-Alt-F1 and kill the screensaver (or just set a
password for the grml user).
