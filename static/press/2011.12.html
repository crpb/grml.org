<h1>Grml 2011.12 - Knecht Rootrecht</h1>
<p>
The Grml project is pleased to announce the availability of its latest release "2011.12", codenamed "Knecht Rootrecht". Grml has been refocused and now specializes in installation&amp;recovery.  
</p>
<p>
In the last 7 months Grml has undergone significant refactoring in order to make future development easier and to give code back to upstream, i.e. Debian. Grml 2011.12 is released in one size (~350MB) for 32bit and 64bit. Thanks to the reduced ISO-image size the Grml project also offers a grml96 (32+64) ISO-image featuring both the 32bit and 64bit versions. <br />
One flavour, two architectures, three options (grml32, grml64, and grml96).
</p>

<p>
"Knecht Rootrecht" is based on Linux 3.1.6. The software selection has been revised and refocused on installation&amp;recovery. The new, slicker software selection provides over 1.1GB of open source software relevant for system administrators. To increase stability, Grml is now based on Debian testing instead of Debian sid.
</p>
<p>
Starting with 2011.12 Grml supports UEFI on 64bit systems. For simplified deployments Grml enables mDNS at startup and starts the necessary services for NFS clients. The graphical environment has been streamlined resulting in a clean and simple desktop.
</p>

<p>
To simplify rescue and recovery tasks Grml 2011.12 contains the necessary tools for ATA over Ethernet as well as the necessary tools to configure the system as a LIO-based iSCSI target. 
</p>

<p>
grml-debootstrap - our tool for automatically installing Debian systems - is now able to build Virtual Machine images as well.
</p>

<p>
grml-live - the tool used to build the official Grml ISO-images - has been reworked and simplified. It is now possible to use grml-live directly on a Grml ISO-image to remaster it with ease without the need to unpack, extract, and keep track of the squashfs image manually.
</p>

<p>
To help visually impaired or simply busy users, Grml will beep at the boot prompt and issue a beep sequence once the system is usable.
