            <h1>grml-small</h1>

            <p>grml-small is a bootable CD (Live-CD) based on Knoppix and Debian.
            grml-small includes a collection of GNU/Linux software for system
            administrators and provides automatic hardware detection.  Whereas grml
            (without the -small) provides more than about 2.1GiB of software on a
            700MB-ISO, grml-small is a very small rescue system for
            systemadministrators.  It is not necessary to install anything to a
            harddisk, you don't even need a harddisk to run it.  Due to on-the-fly
            decompression grml-small includes about 150 MB of software and still fits
            on a business card CD-ROM or USB device with 50MB.</p>
