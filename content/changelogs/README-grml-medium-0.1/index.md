<h3>About</h3>

<p>grml is a Debian-based Live-CD. It includes a collection of GNU/Linux
software especially for users of texttools and system administrators.
grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml for example
as a rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working
environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you
don't even need a harddisk to run it, unless you want to (use grml2hd
for this). Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1GB
of software and documentation on the CD.</p>

<p>Whereas grml provides about 2.1GB of software on a ~700MB ISO and
grml-small is a flavor with only ~60MB ISO-size, grml-medium tries to
close the gap between those two flavours providing an ISO with ~200MB.
It does not provide all the software shipped with normal/big/large grml
but provides essential stuff, a full featured kernel and the X.org
server.  You can use the Debian package management system to install
software on the fly (assuming you have network access to a Debian
mirror). Take a look at the '<a
href="/files/">Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are searching for
the package list.</p>
