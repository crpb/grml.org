software especially for users of texttools and system administrators. grml
provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml for example as a
rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working environment. It
is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you don't even need a
harddisk to run it. Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1
GiB of software and documentation on the CD.</p>
