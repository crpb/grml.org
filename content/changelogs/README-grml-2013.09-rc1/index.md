<h3>About</h3>

<p>This Grml release provides fresh software packages after the Debian
stable release (AKA wheezy) has been released. As usual it also
incorporates up2date hardware support and fixes known bugs from the
previous Grml release.</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<ul>

<li>new boot option <em>encpasswd</em>: takes a hashed password as
argument, setting password of users root and grml to the specified
value

<li><em>grml-hwinfo</em> supports iproute's ip tool, sg_inq from
sg3-utils and lscpu, lsblk, dmsetup ls --tree

<li>grml-lang includes <em>french keymap</em> support

</ul>

<h3>Important Changes</h3>

<ul>

<li><em>UTC</em> is used as default time zone, to use a different
setting you can use the <em>tz</em> boot option (usage example:
tz=Europe/Vienna)

<li>To match the behaviour with the <em>ssh</em> boot option the
<em>passwd</em> boot option now also sets the password for user root -
and not only for user 'grml'.

<li>grml-autoconfig (and its GRMLCFG feature) doesn't support
<em>floppy</em> disks any longer

<li>zshrc: <em>new prompt handling</em>, see <a
href="http://blog.grml.org/archives/381-grml-zshrc-new-prompt-feature.html">Grml
blog for more details</a>

<li>zshrc: to enable <em>power completion</em> / abbreviation
expansion use "ctrl-x ." instead of ",." (see <a
href="https://git.grml.org/f/grml-etc-core/debian/NEWS">debian/NEWS
for details</a>)

<li>Grml does not ship <em>clamav anti-virus definitions</em> any
longer due to space reasons (adding ~70MB to the ISO size). If you
want to get up2date anti-virus definitions please manually invoke the
freshclam utility.

</ul>
