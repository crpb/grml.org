<h3>About</h3>

<p>Grml is a bootable live system (Live-CD) based on Debian. It
includes a collection of GNU/Linux software especially for system
administrators and users of texttools. Grml provides automatic hardware
detection. You can use Grml (for example) as a rescue system, for
analyzing systems/networks or as a working environment. It is not
necessary to install anything to a harddisk; you don't even need a
harddisk to run it. Due to on-the-fly decompression Grml includes about
2 GB of software and documentation on the CD.</p>

<p>Whereas Grml provides about 2 GB of software on a 700 MB ISO, <a
href="/faq/#whatissmall">grml-small</a> is a flavor with only ~100 MB
ISO-size (~275 MB uncompressed). It does not provide a lot of software
but the essential stuff for being a rescue system on a business card
CD-ROM or a small USB device. You can use the Debian package management
system to install software on the fly (assuming you have network access
to a Debian mirror). Take a look at the '<a
href="/files/">Debian-Information</a>'-section if you are searching for
the package list.</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<h4>Special new features:</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>dmraid related bootoptions</strong>: nodmraid to not
enable present dmraid devices,
dmraid=on to automatically enable any present dmraid devices and
dmraid=off to actively try to stop any possibly present dmraid
devices.

<li>New <strong>bootoption bootid</strong> for improving reliability
of boot process. The specified argument to the bootoption is matched
against a token on the ISO to make sure that only the correct Grml
version gets booted.</li>

<li>More <strong>robust network booting</strong>: The last Grml
release (2009.10) already invented the ethdevice= bootoption which
allows you to specify a specific NIC for booting. The bootoption
ethdevice and its surrounding code has been extended so it is possible to specify
multiple devices at once that should be configured. If you don't have
any specific configuration all present NICs will be used for
configuration via DHCP automatically. Visit <a
href="http://grml.supersized.org/archives/337-More-robust-network-booting.html">the
Grml developer blog for further information</a>

<li>Providing an improved <strong>default configuration for
top(1)</strong> utility when running as (non-root) user

<li>Improved <strong>serial console</strong> handling through
/etc/inittab*. Using normal getty instead of mgetty and several baud
rate settings (115200,57600,38400,19200,9600,4800,2400,1200) to let
getty figure out which mode should be used.

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.33.2 including <a
href="/kernel/">several patches</a> and the aufs module.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="/kernel/">grml.org/kernel/</a> for more details
regarding Grml's kernel.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<p>Fixed several bugs and issues reported on <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/grml-small_2009.10">grml-small_2009.10 @
grml-wiki</a> and in the <a href="http://bts.grml.org/grml/">bug
tracking system</a>.</p>

<h3>Important Changes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Bootoption <strong>home</strong> has been dropped, the persistency
feature present since 2009.10 replaces this option.</li>

<li>Grml uses <strong>lang=en as default</strong> instead of lang=us
if no 'lang' bootoption has been specified.</li>

<li>Grml's udev package has been dropped in favour of Debian's plain
version and adding Grml specified configuration and scripts through
Debian package <strong>grml-udev-config</strong>.</li>

<li>As the bootoption <strong>bootid</strong> is used as default
bootoption you need to make sure that you've an according and valid
bootid=... entry in your kernel cmdline or use the ignore_bootid
bootoption to skip the boot id check. This is especially relevant for
grml2usb installations (make sure to use a recent grml2usb version) as
well as booting with isofrom/findiso bootoptions from harddisks.</li>

</ul>
