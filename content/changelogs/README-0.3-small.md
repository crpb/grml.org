<h3>About</h3>

<p>grml is a Debian-based Live-CD. It includes a collection of GNU/Linux
software especially for users of texttools and system administrators. grml
provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml for example as a
rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working environment. It
is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you don't even need a
harddisk to run it. Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1
GiB of software and documentation on the CD.</p>

<p>Whereas grml provides about 2.1 GB of software on a 700 MB
ISO, grml-small is a flavor with only ~58 MB ISO-size (~170 MB
uncompressed). It does not provide a lot of software but the
essential stuff for being a rescue system on a business card
CD-ROM or a small USB device. You can use the Debian package
management system to install software on the fly (assuming you
have network access to a Debian mirror). Take a look at the '<a
href="/files/">Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are
searching for the package list.</p>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<p>Fixed several bugs and issues reported on <a
href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/grml-small_0.2">grml-small_0.2
@ grml-wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<p>Several improved, updated and extended configuration files.</p>

<p>Synched all grml-packages with the ones used in grml 0.9,
providing several new and improved features.</p>

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>Based on vanilla kernel 2.6.18.3 including <a
href="/kernel/">several patches</a>. See <a
href="/kernel/">grml.org/kernel/</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Important Changes</h3>

<p><strong>swap partitions:</strong> by default grml does
<strong>not</strong> automatically use swap partitions anymore.
Run 'grml-swapon' when running grml or boot using 'grml swap'
for enabling all detected and usable swap partitions.</p>

<p><strong>software raid:</strong> starting with grml-small 0.3
booting the system searches for present software raid arrays.
The configuration file /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf will be generated
by default, to disable this feature use the bootopion noswraid.
The arrays are <strong>not</strong> autoassembled by default.
Either boot using the bootoption swraid or run 'Start
mdadm-raid' when running grml already to assemble present
software raid arrays.</p>

<p><strong>zsh global aliases:</strong> the global aliases setup
has been changed; now the global aliases (like: 'G' is same
'|grep') are not enabled by default any more, instead a new
setup named 'powerful abbreviation expansion' is available.
Usage example: type 'N' and press ',.' to expand the 'N' into
'&amp;&gt;/dev/null'. Take a look at <a
href="/zsh/#grmlzshrefcard">the grml zsh refcard</a> for more
details.</p>
