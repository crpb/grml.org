<h3>About</h3>

<p>grml is a Debian-based Live-CD. It includes a collection of GNU/Linux
software especially for users of texttools and system administrators.
grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml for example
as a rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working
environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you
don't even need a harddisk to run it, unless you want to (use grml2hd
for this). Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1GB
of software and documentation on the CD.</p>

<p>Whereas grml provides about 2.1 GB of software on a 700 MB ISO,
grml-small is a flavor with only ~75 MB ISO-size (~240 MB
uncompressed). It does not provide a lot of software but the
essential stuff for being a rescue system on a business card CD-ROM
or a small USB device. You can use the Debian package management
system to install software on the fly (assuming you have network
access to a Debian mirror). Take a look at the <a
href="/files/">'Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are
searching for the package list.</p>
