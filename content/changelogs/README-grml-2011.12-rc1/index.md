<h3>About</h3>

<p>This release brings a downsizing and cleanup: one flavour, two architectures.
The new, smaller flavour has a 350MB ISO size target, while still
delivering over 1.1GB of open source software relevant for system
administrators!</p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<ul>

<li>EFI Boot support from CD-ROM and USB keys (amd64 only)</li>
<li>mDNS support (try <tt>ping grml.local</tt> with libnss-mdns and avahi-daemon
or similar enabled on your host)</li>
<li>NFS Client support and d-bus start automatically</li>
<li><a href="/grml-debootstrap/">grml-debootstrap</a>, the tool of choice to install Debian,
can now directly build virtual machine images.</li>
<li><a href="/grml-live/">grml-live</a>, our build tool, was enhanced with new features to
better integrate with <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>.
This release, as well as the current <a href="/daily/">daily images</a>
are built from within Jenkins!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Z-Shell configuration has been cleaned up. Quite a few functions
<a href="https://git.grml.org/?p=grml-etc-core.git;a=history;f=etc/zsh/zshrc">have been removed</a>
from the default configuration.</li>
<li>X11 environment has been downsized as well. The window manager is
now fluxbox. idesk has been removed, all available software is now
reachable from the fluxbox menu.</li>
<li>The accessibility support now consists of shipping standard speakup
and enabling sound during boot. A new beep sequence (4 tones) is sounded
just before the quickconfig menu starts. (The boot options have been
removed.)</li>
<li>xterm now uses the Terminus font, like the VT consoles.</li>
<li>Virtual Machines automatically get the "noprompt" behaviour.</li>
<li>Ancient config files and examples have been removed from grml-etc(-core).</li>
<li>Ancient scripts have been removed from grml-scripts(-core).</li>
<br>
<li>Anonymous stats are collected during boot up. This includes: Grml release name,
boot media type (local or remote), a random string, used boot option keys
(no values) and if your CPU is 64bit-capable. You can turn this off with the
<b>nostats</b> boot option.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bits &amp; bolts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Modem support has been removed from grml-network</li>
<li>VT consoles are driven by grml-runtty, our homegrown login and getty
replacement for Live CDs.</li>
<li>Netboot scenarios should no longer use the "nodhcp" boot option.</li>
<li>grml2hd is no longer in PATH to discourage its use even further.
The related boot options have been removed.</li>
<li>grml2usb: compat for releases &lt; 2009.05, grub1 and lilo support
have been removed.</li>
<li>Release builds are now built from Debian's testing distribution, instead of unstable.</li>
<li>Linux kernel is based on <b>3.1.4</b>. No additional modules are shipped.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs from the <a href="http://bts.grml.org/grml/">bug tracking system</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>Packages are taken from Debian testing, 11th of December
2011. 1745 packages have been removed, and these new packages
have been added (plus dependencies):</p>
<pre class="rahmen">
afflib-tools aoetool atftp bacula-sd efibootmgr
grub-efi-amd64-bin ia32-libs imvirt ipxe mcollective
mtx multiarch-support netcat-openbsd python2.7 sipcalc
vblade
</pre>

<p>These Grml packages have been removed/replaced:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml-debugtools grml-docs grml-files grml-files64
grml-firefox grml-laptop grml-pylib grml-rebuildfstab
grml-rescueboot grml-sectools grml-templates grml-usleep
grml-vpn grml grml64
</pre>

<h3>Known issues</h3>

<p><b>iSCSI Target</b> support is currently in limbo, as
the user land tools for the new in-kernel iSCSI target are not yet
in Debian unstable/testing and shipping the old iscsitarget modules
in binary form appears to be almost impossible with the new DKMS packaging.
As a workaround you may consider using Ata Over Ethernet with vblade.
</p>

<p><b>dns bootoption</b> does not work as expected. See <a
href="http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue1099">issue1099</a> for details.</p>
