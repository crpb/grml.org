Please check for [known bugs](/bugs/known/) before reporting new ones.

Send us your bug report to `bugs (at) grml.org` or open a new issue in our repositories on GitHub.

We track issues at [github.com/grml/grml/issues](https://github.com/grml/grml/issues).

Several Grml sub-projects (grml-debootstrap, grml-etc-core, grml2usb,...) have their own repository and issue tracking, see [github.com/grml/](https://github.com/grml/) to get an overview.
If you're unsure where to report an issue though, feel free to use [github.com/grml/grml/issues](https://github.com/grml/grml/issues) though.

Please be as specific as possible. Include at least:

* Steps to reproduce the problem
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Your system configuration (e.g. run `grml-hwinfo`)
* Software versions (`grml-version` and for the tool in question try `foo --version` or `dpkg -l foo`)

Take a look at [How to Report Bugs Effectively](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

Note: all bugs are made public.

**Thank you for helping us improve Grml!**
