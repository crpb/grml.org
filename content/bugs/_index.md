Please check for [known bugs](/bugs/known/) before reporting new ones.

Send us your bug report to <code>bugs (at) grml.org</code> or open a new issue in our repositories on Github.
We track issues at <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/issues">github.com/grml/grml/issues</a>.
Several Grml sub-projects (grml-debootstrap, grml-etc-core, grml2usb,...) have their own repository and issue tracking,
see <a href="https://github.com/grml/">github.com/grml/</a> to get an overview. If you're unsure where to report an issue though,
feel free to use <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/issues">github.com/grml/grml/issues</a> though.

Please be as specific as possible. Include at least:

* Steps to reproduce the problem
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Your system configuration (e.g. run <code>grml-hwinfo</code>)
* Software versions (<code>grml-version</code> and for the tool in question try <code>foo --version</code> or <code>dpkg -l foo</code>)

Take a look at "<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>".

Note: all bugs are made public.

**Thank you for helping us improve Grml!**
