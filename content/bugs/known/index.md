<p>We track issues at <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/issues">github.com/grml/grml/issues</a>.
Several Grml sub-projects (grml-debootstrap, grml-etc-core, grml2usb,...) have their own repository and issue tracking,
see <a href="https://github.com/grml/">github.com/grml/</a> to get an overview. If you're unsure where to report an issue though,
feel free to use <a href="https://github.com/grml/grml/issues">github.com/grml/grml/issues</a> though.

<p>If you find additional bugs, please <a href="/bugs/">report them</a>.</p>
