Starting with version 0.5 Grml provides a configuration system.
Please see [grml-autoconfig.1.html](grml-autoconfig.1.html) for details.

In Grml releases up to and including 2009.05 the documentation is available on the
grml ISO via `man save-config` and as
[/usr/share/doc/grml-saveconfig/grml-config.html](file:///usr/share/doc/grml-saveconfig/grml-config.html).

In Grml releases after 2009.05 the documentation is available on the
grml ISO via `man 1 grml-autoconfig` and as
[/usr/share/doc/grml-autoconfig/grml-autoconfig.1.html](file:///usr/share/doc/grml-autoconfig/grml-autoconfig.1.html).
