## Mailing lists
{{< anchor mailinglist >}}

If you want to be notified when a **new Grml release** is available, subscribe to the read-only [Grml announce mailing list](http://ml.grml.org/mailman/listinfo/grml-announce).

If you want to participate in the **user mailing list of Grml**, please subscribe to the [Grml user mailing list](http://ml.grml.org/mailman/listinfo/grml).
Anyone can post to this mailing list, but if you are not already subscribed, your message will need moderator approval before being posted.
This way we limit the amount of spam that makes it to the list.
The Grml user mailing list is also available via NNTP on [gmane.io](https://gmane.io/).

If you are interested in following the **development of Grml** you might be interested in the [Grml developer mailing list](http://ml.grml.org/mailman/listinfo/grml-devel).
The [Grml repository commits mailing list](http://ml.grml.org/mailman/listinfo/git-commits) tracks all the pushed commits to [Grml's git repositories](https://git.grml.org/), while we're also present on [github](https://github.com/grml/).
Changes in Grml's Debian repository can be tracked via the [Grml Testing-changes mailing list](http://ml.grml.org/mailman/listinfo/grml-testing-changes).
We track issues at [https://github.com/grml/grml/issues](github.com/grml/grml/issues).
Several Grml sub-projects (grml-debootstrap, grml-etc-core, grml2usb,...) have their own repository and issue tracking, see [github.com/grml/](https://github.com/grml/) to get an overview.
If you're unsure where to report an issue though, feel free to use [github.com/grml/grml/issues](https://github.com/grml/grml/issues) though.
