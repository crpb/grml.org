grml-small is a bootable CD (Live-CD) based on Knoppix and Debian.

grml-small includes a collection of GNU/Linux software for system administrators and provides automatic hardware detection.

Whereas grml (without the -small) provides more than about 2.1GiB of software on a 700MB-ISO, grml-small is a very small rescue system for systemadministrators.

It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk, you don't even need a harddisk to run it.

Due to on-the-fly decompression grml-small includes about 150 MB of software and still fits on a business card CD-ROM or USB device with 50MB.
