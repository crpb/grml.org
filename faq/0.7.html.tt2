        <h3><a name="whatis"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml?</a></h3>

        <p>grml is a bootable CD (Live-CD) once based on <a
        href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> and nowadays based on <a
        href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. grml includes a collection of
        GNU/Linux software especially for users of texttools and system
        administrators.  grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml
        as a rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks, or as a working
        environment. It is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk. Due to
        on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1 GB of software and
        documentation on the CD.</p>

        <h3><a name="get"></a><a href="#toc">Where do I get grml?</a></h3>

        <p>You can download grml of course: take a look at <a
        href="/download">grml.org/download/</a>. If you want
        to get an original grml-CD including <a
        href="/files/#covers">the grml-cover</a>, need a
        special amount of CDs or want your own special grml-CD (including
        your logo, your software and/or special settings) <a
        href="/contact/">please don't hesitate to contact
        us</a>! Take a look at <a
        href="http://solutions.grml.org/">grml-solutions</a> for more
        information regarding our offers.</p>

        <h3><a name="whatmeans"></a><a href="#toc">What does grml mean?</a></h3>

        <p>grml is short for 'grummel' and comes close to 'argl' or 'grrr' in English. People
        use this when they want to express their dissatisfaction/discontentedness with software
        (amongst other things):</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ grep -ch grml .centericq/**/history | xargs echo | \
  sed 's/[0-9]*/&amp; + /g' | sed 's/+ $//g' | bc -l
3746</pre>

        <h3><a name="pronounce"></a><a href="#toc">How do you pronounce grml?</a></h3>

<pre class="rahmen">
% flite -o play -t gremel</pre>

<!--
 $ echo 'ghroummel' | festival \-\-tts
-->
 
        <h3><a name="releasename"></a><a href="#toc">What about the release name?</a></h3>

        <p>Codename of grml 0.7 is Bootenschnitzl. This is derived from the
        German word putenschnitzel. A putenschnitzel is a turkey hen cutlet.
        Therefore, a Bootenschnitzl is a bootable cutlet.</p>

        <p>Codename of grml-small 0.2 is Corry. Corry is the nickname of <a
        href="/team/">Michael Gebetsroither's</a> girlfriend.</p>

        <h3><a name="requirements"></a><a href="#toc">Requirements for running grml</a></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Intel-compatible CPU (i586 or later, preferably Pentium class or higher)</li>
          <li>at least 64MB of RAM (for stable use with ramdisks for unionfs and udev and running X window system
          we recommend at least 128MB)</li>
          <li>grml-small: at least 32MB RAM should be available</li>
          <li>bootable CD-ROM drive (or a boot floppy and standard CD-ROM [IDE/ATAPI
          or SCSI]) [or network - see <a href="#terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a>]</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="why"></a><a href="#toc">Why another Linux distribution?</a></h3>

        <p>There already exist &quot;<a
        href="http://www.distrowatch.com/">some</a>&quot; distributions. We decided
        to base our work on the existing infrastructure of <a
        href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a
        href="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a> because we don't want to reinvent
        the wheel.  Some admins already use their own rescue-CD and Knoppix works but
        does not bring that many important tools for admins and users of texttools
        out of the box, so we decided to share our work with others.</p>

        <h3><a name="license"></a><a href="#toc">What's the license of grml?</a></h3>

        <p>Anything written by the grml team is published under the GPL (<a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>).
        You don't have to pay anything for running grml. <a
        href="/donations/">Donations</a> and <a href="/contact/">feedback</a> are
        welcome of course. If you want a special LiveCD or need support, take a
        look at <a href="http://solutions.grml.org/">grml-solutions</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="difference"></a><a href="#toc">What's the difference between grml and
        $OTHER-DISTRIBUTION? What are your main goals?</a></h3>

        <p>The main goal of grml is to be a distribution well suited for
        users of texttools and sysadmins. grml includes many important
        texttools (of course awk, sed, grep, ...  but also zsh, mutt[ng],
        slrn, vim and many others) and useful programs for admin's
        daily work. grml uses the existing infrastructure of <a
        href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. grml was once based on <a
        href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> (see '<a
        href="#knoppix">What's the difference between grml and
        Knoppix?</a>' for more details). We are also merging
        useful things from other distributions/live-cds to provide a
        perfect environment.</p>

        <h3><a name="knoppix"></a><a href="#toc">What's the difference between grml and Knoppix?</a></h3>

        <p>grml comes with a vastly different set of software. Missing KDE
        and OpenOffice provides the opportunity of shipping more than 800
        packages which Knoppix does not provide on its CD version. grml
        boots a 2.6.x kernel but no X for faster startup. Knoppix is based
        on Debian/testing-experimental (using apt-pinning), but grml is
        basically based on plain Debian/unstable providing more current
        versions of software and less painfull upgrades. grml was once
        based on Knoppix but nowadays (except for a similar initial
        ramdisk) has nothing in common with Knoppix:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
# locate knoppix
# find / -iname \*knoppix\*
#</pre>

        <p>We consider Knoppix as a brand name for live-cds nowadays and
        provide most of Knoppix' features as well. grml uses (mostly) the
        same cheatcodes for booting as Knoppix and even provides some extra
        ones. So if you are used to the basic Knoppix features you might
        find them on the grml-system as well.  Ripping out the Knoppix
        stuff makes it possible to create a grml system out of a
        Debian system and vice versa. Running 'apt-get install grml' on a
        Debian box will be officially supported in an upcoming version of
        grml.</p>

        <h3><a name="accessibility"></a><a href="#toc">What does accessibility at grml mean?</a></h3>

        <p>The grml kernel includes <a href="/kernel/#speakup">support for
        speakup</a> and provides software like brltty (using bootoption 'grml blind
        brltty=type,port,tbl'), emacspeak and flite.</p>

        <h3><a name="emulation"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to run grml with $EMULATOR?</a></h3>

        <p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> should work without any
        problems. It's also possible to run grml with <a
        href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a>, an emulator for various
        CPUs which works on Linux, Windows, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Running grml with
        QEMU has been tested successfully on Windows and Linux.  Take a look at <a
        href="/qemu/">the QEMU-grml-webpage</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="usbboot"></a><a href="#toc">How do I boot grml from a USB stick?</a></h3>

        <p>Take a look at the script <a
        href="http://grml.org/scripts/grml2usb">grml2usb</a>. For more
        details, take a look at the <a
        href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb">usb-webpage in the
        grml-wiki.</a></p>

        <h3><a name="store"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to store my settings?</a></h3>

        <p>Yes. grml provides a powerful config framework. See <a
        href="/config/">grml.org/config/</a>, <a
        href="file:///usr/share/doc/grml-saveconfig/grml-config.html">/usr/share/doc/grml-saveconfig/grml-config.html</a>
        and 'man save-config restore-config mkpersistenthome' for more
        details.</p>

        <h2><a name="grmlsmall"></a><a href="#toc">grml-small?</a></h2>

        <h3><a name="whatissmall"></a><a href="#toc">What is grml-small?</a></h3>

        <p>Whereas grml provides about 2.1 GB of software on a 700 MB ISO, grml-small
        is a flavor with online ~55 MB ISO-size (~200 MB uncompressed).  It does not
        provide a lot of software but the essential stuff for being a rescue system
        on a business card CD-ROM or a small USB device. You can use the Debian
        package management system to install software on the fly (assuming you have
        network access to a Debian mirror). Take a look at the <a
        href="/files/">'Debian-Information'-section</a> if you are
        searching for the package list.</p>

        <h3><a name="smallvsnormal"></a><a href="#toc">What is the
        difference between 'normal' grml and grml-small?</a></h3>

        <p>The 700 MB-grml brings more than 2370 packages of software and a <a
        href="/kernel/">full-featured kernel</a>.  grml-small includes
        about 215 software packages, lacks documentation and manpages on the ISO and
        has a stripped-down <a href="/kernel/">kernel</a> (but still
        provides hardware detection of course).  <a
        href="#terminalserver">grml-terminalserver</a> is <strong>not</strong>
        available/supported on grml-small.</p>

        <h3><a name="grmlvsdsl"></a><a href="#toc">What is the
        difference between grml-small and DSL?</a></h3>

        <p>DSL and grml-small have different target audiences. <a
        href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> (DSL) uses kernel
        version 2.4 whereas grml-small provides a recent version of kernel version
        2.6.  DSL provides the X window system which grml-small does not. grml-small
        provides the most important packages for sysadmins and ships the original
        Debian package management which allows you to install packages of the Debian
        pool with no modifications.</p>

        <h2><a name="system"></a><a href="#toc">System</a></h2>

        <h3><a name="configure"></a><a href="#toc">Which tools exist to configure grml?</a></h3>

        <p>grml provides several scripts and tools which should make life
        easier. See 'dpkg -L grml-scripts' to get an overview of some main
        scripts. Run 'grml-config' to get a dialog interface for the most
        important scripts and tasks.</p>

        <h3><a name="password"></a><a href="#toc">What are the passwords of users on grml?</a></h3>

        <p>There are no default passwords. All accounts are locked by
        default.  Even local logins are not possible (unless you set a
        password or create new user accounts as root).  You can create
        valid passwords using "sudo passwd [username]" from the shell
        individually.</p>

        <h3><a name="version"></a><a href="#toc">How do I find out the version of grml</a></h3>

        <p>Run 'grml-version' or use the following command:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ cat /etc/grml_version</pre>

        <h3><a name="remove_cd"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to run LiveCD and eject CD-ROM?</a></h3>

<pre class="rahmen">
$ sudo umount -l /cdrom
$ sudo eject /dev/cdrom # now don't run any new programs ;)
$ mount /dev/cdrom      # mount it again if needed ;)
</pre>

        <h3><a name="language"></a><a href="#toc">How do I change the language/keyboard settings?</a></h3>

        <p>By default grml uses English settings. But it is possible to
        change the settings via using either the bootparam(s) lang,
        keyboard and xkeyboard or via running grml-lang when grml is
        already running. Usage examples:</p>

<pre class="rahmen">
grml lang=de      # enter this at the bootprompt and you will get
                  # German keyboard layout and German $LANG, $LC_ALL,
                  # $LANGUAGE...
grml keyboard=de xkeyboard=de lang=at # enter this at the bootprompt
                  # and you will get German keyboard and Austrian
                  # language variables
$ grml-lang de    # enter this in the shell to switch keyboard layout
                  # and $LANG settings in a running grml-system
</pre>

        <p>If you are running grml from harddisk (using <a
        href="#hdinstall">grml2hd</a>) you have several options how to set
        language options:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>adjust /etc/environment to configure global language
          settings</li>

          <li>set $LC_ALL, $LANG, $LANGUAGE in your ~/.xinitrc (before the
          'exec $WINDOWMANAGER line' of course) to configure the
          language behaviour of programs</li>

          <li>adjust /etc/sysconfig/keyboard to configure keyboard layout
          on console, or run 'loadkeys $KEYTABLE' manually</li>

          <li>add 'setxkbmap $LANGUAGE' to the keybindings section in
          your ~/.xinitrc to configure keyboard setup in X window system
          (deactivate the xmodmap lines if necessary)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3><a name="kde_and_foo"></a><a href="#toc">KDE, Gnome, $FOO and $BAR</a></h3>

        <p>Why isn't KDE, Gnome, $FOO or $BAR part of grml? grml is a distribution
        for users of texttools and sysadmins. If you would like to run KDE with
        Debian use e.g. <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a>, <a
        href="http://www.munjoylinux.org/">Munjoy-Linux</a>, <a
        href="http://kanotix.com/">Kanotix</a> or <a
        href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>.  Gnome users might find <a
        href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> useful. If you would like to
        see a specific (software) package added to grml please <a

        <h3><a name="wms"></a><a href="#toc">Which window managers can I use?</a></h3>

        <p>grml is shipped only with window managers which are lightweight and
        fast - so well suited for a live-CD. At the moment, grml provides these window managers:
        <a href="http://www.6809.org.uk/evilwm/">evilwm</a>,

        <p>If you are new to grml and/or prefer an easy-to-use-desktop run 'grml-x
        wm-ng' for starting fluxbox with idesk and gkrellm.</p>

        <h3><a name="usbmount"></a><a href="#toc">How do I mount a USB device / USB stick?</a></h3>

        <p>Run 'mount /mnt/external1' for example if you want to mount
        /dev/sda1. udev on grml does multiplexing for USB block devices,
        /dev/external1 is a symlink to /dev/sda1.</p>

        <h3><a name="booting"></a><a href="#toc">Which ways exist to boot grml?</a></h3>

        <p>The most common way to boot grml is, of course, running from
        CD-ROM, but grml provides many more ways to boot grml:</p>

        <p>It is possible to boot grml via USB (e.g. USB stick or harddisk),
        firewire, or running from a Compact Flash disk. It works out of the
        box; you don't need to modify anything. If accessing the device
        fails, use the 'scandelay' cheatcode on bootprompt. So, boot with
        'grml scandelay'. If the timeout is still not long enough add the
        time to wait in seconds as parameter: 'grml scandelay=15'. See <a
        href="https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/usb">usb-webpage in the
        grml-wiki</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>Your computer can not boot from CD-ROM but provides a floppy
        disk? Take a look at <a
        href="http://btmgr.webframe.org/">btmgr</a>, <a
        href="http://ubcd4win.com/faq.htm#floppy">ubcd4win</a> or <a
        href="http://linux.simple.be/tools/sbm">sbm</a>. They provide
        support for booting from CD-ROM via a special floppy disk.</p>

        <p>grml-terminalserver makes it possible to boot your system
        via network. If you have a floppy drive, you can even boot your
        system over network when your network card does not provide
        PXE-support! For more information, refer to the <a
        href="/terminalserver/">grml-terminalserver-webpage</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="hdinstall"></a><a href="#toc">Is it possible to install grml to harddisk?</a></h3>

        <p>Yes. grml provides a tool called grml2hd (see '<a
        href="/grml2hd/grml2hd.html">man grml2hd</a>').  grml is developed on a box
        running the grml-system itself, and we - the grml-developers - especially like
        grml2hd because it gives us a working Linux box within 10 to 30 minutes!
        grml2hd is perfect for prototyping: test hardware support of Linux, test a
        specific setup, ... You can even use grml2hd in a fully automatic mode without
        any further interaction. More information is available on <a
        href="/grml2hd/">grml.org/grml2hd/</a> and <a
        href="/grml2hd/grml2hd.html">man grml2hd</a>. Notice: If you are using grml
        in a production environment and/or use a grml2hd installation, we strongly
        recommend you subscribe to <a href="/mailinglist/">the grml user
        mailinglist</a>! Note that grml is based on Debian unstable, so you should
        be familiar with Debian unstable if you plan to use grml as a harddisk
        system.</p>

        <p>Where are all the /etc/rc#.d-directories? grml doesn't use

        editor. No symlink-hell anymore.</p>

        <h3><a name="zsh"></a><a href="#toc">Why is zsh the default shell (/bin/sh)?</a></h3>

        <p>Short answer: because zsh rocks.</p>

        <p>Longer answer taken from <a href="http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/zshfaq01.html#l3">ZSH
        FAQ: 1.2: What is it?</a>:</p>

        <cite> Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells most
        resembles the Korn shell (ksh); its compatibility with the 1988 Korn shell has been
        gradually increasing. It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the
        command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour, filename globbing, features
        to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra features drawn from tcsh
        (another `custom' shell).</cite>

        <p>If you don't know zsh take a look at <a
        href="http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/zshfaq02.html#l9">ZSH FAQ: How does zsh
        differ from ...?</a>, 'man zsh | less -p COMPATIBILITY' and '<a
        href="/zsh/">man zsh-lovers</a>'.</p>

        <p>If you are a bash user and don't know zsh yet, don't be afraid. bash is largely a
        subset of zsh and you don't have to throw away your knowledge about shell stuff.</p>

        <h3><a name="zsh_binsh"></a><a href="#toc">Wasn't zsh the /bin/sh interpreter?</a></h3>

        <p>Yes, until grml 0.6 zsh was the intepreter for /bin/sh. Starting
        with release 0.7 grml uses /bin/bash as /bin/sh. The reason?
        Debian does not support zsh as /bin/sh. Take a look at <a
        href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=329288">#329288</a>
        and <a
        href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=340058">#340058</a>
        for example.</p>

        <h3><a name="bash"></a><a href="#toc">Is a bash available?</a></h3>

        <p>grml uses <a href="#zsh">zsh</a> as the default shell but, of
        course, a current version of bash (and many other shells as well)
        is provided by grml.</p>

        <h3><a name="setuid"></a><a href="#toc">setuid/SUID</a></h3>

        <p>If you set a programm SUID (setuid/mode 4755), unprivileged users on your system will
        be able to run it. This <em>could</em> be a potentially security hole, so by default the
        packages are configured not to install binaries with setuid. If you want to use the
        binaries with setuid please run 'dpkg-reconfigure $packagename' or 'chmod 4755
        =programm'. The following packages are well known to have a programm with not set
        setuid:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>hddtemp</li>
          <li>pconsole</li>
          <li>pdsh</li>

        <h3><a name="aide"></a><a href="#toc">aide</a></h3>

        <h3><a name="ipw"></a><a href="#toc">Using IPW driver with DHCP</a></h3>

        <p>The ipw-drivers in grml already contain special fixes for fixing
        problems with ipw and kernel &gt;=2.6.13, but you might have to run
        'iwlist $DEVICE scanning' (adjust $DEVICE with the corresponding
        network device) to get an associated connection to the access
        point.</p>

        <h3><a name="wpa"></a><a href="#toc">Using WPA with &gt;=2.6.13-grml</a></h3>

        <p><a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Vanilla kernel</a> include
        wireless extensions now (starting with 2.6.13: version 18
        [12.3.05]).  The ipw2200 module uses the wireless extensions
        instead of custom ioctl()s now. As a result you have to use
        '-Dwext' for wpa_supplicant to use the wireless extensions when
        wpa_supplicant is running. Adjust $OPTIONS in
        /etc/default/wpasupplicant, for example using:</p>
